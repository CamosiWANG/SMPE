#Subject 3: The London cholera epidemic of 1854

This project is SMPE practice. Here are 2 files and a directory. The TP_YangtaoWANG.pdf is the final report and the TP_YangtaoWANG.Rmd is the source of the report. The data directory contains the data for this TP. 

As there is a problem in generation the pdf: the page 3 is an empty page, due to too much mistery white space padding before the images, I deleted the page 3, so the page number on the report might be wrong.
